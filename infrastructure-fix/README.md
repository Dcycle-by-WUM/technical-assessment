# Enterprise Infrastructure Architecture Challenge

## Overview

This challenge presents you with a Cloud Development Kit (CDK) application that requires enterprise-grade architectural improvements. As an Engineering Director, your task is to evaluate the current implementation and develop a comprehensive infrastructure strategy that addresses reliability, security, cost optimization, and operational excellence at scale.

## The Infrastructure

The application is a serverless backend for a customer data platform that includes:

- Multiple environments (development, staging, production)
- DynamoDB tables for customer data storage
- Lambda functions for API endpoints and data processing
- EventBridge for event-driven workflows
- CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting

The infrastructure code is implemented but requires strategic improvements to make it production-ready for enterprise use.

## Challenge Tasks

1. **Multi-Environment Strategy**
   - Evaluate the current environment configuration approach
   - Design an improved multi-environment strategy (dev, staging, production)
   - Address cross-environment data management challenges
   - Develop a promotion strategy for infrastructure changes

2. **Security and Compliance Framework**
   - Identify security vulnerabilities in the current implementation
   - Design a comprehensive security architecture
   - Implement appropriate IAM policies and permission boundaries
   - Address data encryption, auditing, and compliance requirements

3. **Reliability and Disaster Recovery**
   - Design a high-availability architecture
   - Develop a comprehensive backup and recovery strategy
   - Create a disaster recovery plan with defined RPO/RTO targets
   - Address regional failover considerations

4. **Cost Optimization**
   - Identify cost optimization opportunities
   - Develop strategies for resource right-sizing
   - Implement cost allocation and tagging strategies
   - Design for scalability without excessive over-provisioning

5. **Operational Excellence**
   - Develop a monitoring and observability strategy
   - Create an incident response and escalation framework
   - Design deployment pipelines for safe infrastructure changes
   - Implement infrastructure-as-code best practices

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- Strategic cloud architecture vision
- Security and compliance considerations at enterprise scale
- Operational excellence and reliability planning
- Cost optimization and resource efficiency strategies
- Technical governance and best practices implementation

## Submission Format

Please provide your response as a comprehensive document that includes:

1. Infrastructure architecture diagrams and explanations
2. Security and compliance framework
3. Reliability and disaster recovery plan
4. Cost optimization strategy
5. Operational excellence recommendations

You may also include code changes or configuration modifications to support your strategic recommendations.

## Getting Started

1. Review the codebase to understand the current implementation
2. Identify architectural limitations and enterprise-scale challenges
3. Develop your strategic recommendations

```bash
cd infrastructure-fix
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Good luck!
