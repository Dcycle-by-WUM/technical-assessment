# TypeScript Code Review Challenge

## Overview

This challenge assesses your ability to review code effectively - a critical skill for engineering managers. You are presented with a Next.js application that contains several intentional issues, anti-patterns, and areas for improvement.

## Challenge Description

As an Engineering Manager, you've been asked to review a pull request containing a new feature implementation in the company's Next.js application. The code has been written by a mid-level developer and needs your feedback before it can be merged.

Your task is to:

1. Review the code in this directory
2. Identify issues, bugs, and areas for improvement
3. Provide constructive feedback as you would in a real code review
4. Suggest specific improvements with explanations of why they matter

## Areas to Consider

The code may contain issues in the following areas:

- **Performance problems** - inefficient renders, unnecessary re-renders, poor data fetching strategies
- **Architectural concerns** - component structure, state management, separation of concerns
- **TypeScript usage** - proper typing, type safety issues, excessive use of "any"
- **Security issues** - potential vulnerabilities or exposures
- **Accessibility problems** - non-compliant components or practices
- **Best practices** - deviations from React/Next.js best practices
- **Code organization** - structure, naming conventions, code splitting
- **Error handling** - inadequate or missing error handling

## Evaluation Criteria

Your review will be evaluated based on:

1. **Thoroughness** - How comprehensive is your review? Did you catch subtle issues?
2. **Technical accuracy** - Are your observations correct and relevant?
3. **Communication style** - How effectively do you communicate technical concerns?
4. **Prioritization** - Do you distinguish between critical issues and minor improvements?
5. **Constructiveness** - Are your suggestions helpful and actionable?
6. **Knowledge depth** - Do you demonstrate strong understanding of React, Next.js, and TypeScript?

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create a document (Markdown preferred) with your code review feedback
2. Organize your feedback by file and/or by issue category
3. For each issue identified:
   - Reference the specific file and line number
   - Explain why it's problematic
   - Suggest a specific improvement
4. Include a summary of the most critical issues that should be addressed before merging

## Time Expectation

We expect this challenge to take approximately 90-120 minutes to complete.

## Getting Started

1. Explore the Next.js application in this directory
2. Run the application locally to understand its functionality
3. Review the code and provide your feedback according to the guidelines above

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Access the application at http://localhost:3000

## Next.js Project Information

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The application structure includes:

- `src/app/` - The main pages of the application using Next.js App Router
- `src/components/` - Reusable components
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions
