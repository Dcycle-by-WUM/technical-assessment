# Technical Strategy & Codebase Evaluation Challenge

## Overview

This challenge presents you with a Next.js application that requires strategic technical leadership and architectural evaluation. As an Engineering Director, your task is to assess the application from an architectural perspective, identify systemic issues, and develop a comprehensive strategy for technical improvement.

## The Application

The application is a medium-sized dashboard for a SaaS product that includes:

- User authentication and role-based access control
- Data visualization components
- REST and GraphQL API integrations
- Real-time updates via WebSockets
- Form processing with complex validation
- State management across multiple components

## Challenge Tasks

1. **Architectural Assessment**
   - Evaluate the overall architecture and identify systemic issues
   - Assess scalability limitations in the current implementation
   - Identify technical debt and categorize by impact and remediation effort
   - Review the component hierarchy and state management approach

2. **Technical Strategy Development**
   - Create a prioritized technical debt reduction roadmap with implementation timelines
   - Develop architectural guidelines that would improve the codebase
   - Outline refactoring initiatives with clear milestones
   - Propose team structure and resource allocation for implementing changes

3. **Coding Standards & Team Scaling**
   - Establish TypeScript coding standards that would scale across engineering teams
   - Create guidelines for component design, testing, and documentation
   - Develop an approach for knowledge sharing and code ownership
   - Define metrics to measure the success of architectural improvements

4. **Executive Summary**
   - Prepare an executive summary of your findings and recommendations
   - Include risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Outline expected business impact of implementing your recommendations
   - Provide a high-level implementation plan with phases and key milestones

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- Strategic vision and architectural thinking
- Ability to balance technical debt against business priorities
- Technical leadership in establishing standards and best practices
- Effectiveness of proposed implementation and rollout strategy
- Forward-thinking approaches to code maintainability and team scalability

## Submission Format

Please provide your response as a comprehensive document that includes:

1. Architectural assessment findings
2. Technical debt inventory and prioritization framework
3. Proposed architectural guidelines and standards
4. Implementation roadmap with resource requirements
5. Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

You may also include diagrams, code snippets, or other visual aids to support your analysis and recommendations.

## Getting Started

1. Review the codebase thoroughly
2. Run the application locally to understand its behavior
3. Identify architectural patterns and anti-patterns
4. Develop your strategic recommendations

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Good luck!
