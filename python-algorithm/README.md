# System Algorithm Strategy Challenge

## Overview

This challenge presents you with a recommendation engine system that requires strategic architectural decisions to scale effectively. As an Engineering Director, your task is to develop a comprehensive strategy for implementing and scaling this algorithm-driven system across multiple services while addressing data volume growth, infrastructure scaling, and team coordination challenges.

## The System

The system is a product recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform with:

- Multiple data sources (user behavior, product catalog, inventory)
- Real-time and batch processing components
- API services for recommendations delivery
- Performance monitoring requirements
- Cross-team dependencies (Data Science, Backend, DevOps)

The core recommendation algorithm is implemented but requires architectural decisions to make it production-ready and scalable.

## Challenge Tasks

1. **System Architecture Strategy**
   - Evaluate the current implementation and identify architectural limitations
   - Design a scalable system architecture for the recommendation engine
   - Address data volume scaling and throughput requirements
   - Develop a strategy for handling both real-time and batch processing needs

2. **Implementation Planning**
   - Create a phased implementation roadmap with clear milestones
   - Develop guidelines for service boundaries and interface contracts
   - Establish data access patterns and caching strategies
   - Define the approach for algorithm versioning and A/B testing

3. **Cross-functional Coordination**
   - Outline roles and responsibilities across Data Science, Backend, and DevOps teams
   - Establish communication protocols and handoff procedures
   - Develop a strategy for knowledge sharing and collaborative development
   - Create decision frameworks for resolving cross-team technical conflicts

4. **Monitoring and Operational Excellence**
   - Design monitoring and observability requirements
   - Establish performance SLAs and measurement methodologies
   - Create an incident response and escalation framework
   - Define strategies for continuous improvement and algorithm refinement

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- System-level architectural thinking
- Strategic approach to algorithm scaling and optimization
- Cross-functional considerations (DevOps, SRE, Data Science)
- Risk identification and mitigation planning
- Alignment of technical solutions with business objectives

## Submission Format

Please provide your response as a comprehensive document that includes:

1. System architecture diagrams and explanations
2. Implementation roadmap with phases and milestones
3. Team structure and coordination framework
4. Monitoring and observability strategy
5. Risk assessment and mitigation plan

You may also include code examples or configuration snippets where appropriate to illustrate key architectural decisions.

## Getting Started

1. Review the codebase to understand the current implementation
2. Identify architectural limitations and scaling challenges
3. Develop your strategic recommendations

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Good luck!
