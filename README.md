# Engineering Director Assessment Framework

Welcome to our Engineering Director Assessment Framework! This repository contains a set of challenges designed to evaluate different aspects of technical leadership and strategic engineering competencies. Each challenge focuses on a specific area of expertise, allowing candidates to demonstrate their architectural vision, technical decision-making, team leadership capabilities, and strategic planning skills.

## Overview

This assessment consists of four distinct challenges:

1. **Technical Strategy & Codebase Evaluation** - Evaluate a Next.js application through a director's lens, focusing on architectural patterns, technical debt strategy, and team scaling considerations
2. **System Algorithm Strategy** - Develop a strategic approach to algorithm implementation within a system, considering scalability, maintainability, and cross-team coordination
3. **Enterprise Infrastructure Architecture** - Design and document infrastructure strategies for a CDK application with DynamoDB and Lambda, focusing on resilience, security, and cost optimization
4. **Enterprise System Architecture** - Create a comprehensive technical vision and roadmap for a mobile application ecosystem based on business requirements

## How to Proceed

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account
2. Create a separate branch for each challenge you attempt
3. Complete the challenges according to the instructions below
4. Create a pull request for each challenge when ready to submit
5. Ensure your solutions demonstrate strategic thinking, architectural vision, and include comprehensive documentation with rationales for your decisions

## Challenges

### 1. Technical Strategy & Codebase Evaluation

**Location:** `/typescript-review`

**Objective:** Evaluate a Next.js application from an architectural perspective, identifying systemic issues, developing a technical debt strategy, and establishing coding standards that would scale across engineering teams.

**Setup:**
```bash
cd typescript-review
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Requirements:**
- Identify architectural and systemic issues that would impact scalability and team productivity
- Develop a technical debt prioritization strategy with implementation timelines
- Create coding standards and architectural guidelines for the team
- Outline a refactoring roadmap with milestones and resource allocation
- Document your strategic approach, including rationales for prioritization decisions

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Strategic vision and architectural thinking
- Ability to balance technical debt against business priorities
- Technical leadership in establishing standards and best practices
- Effectiveness of proposed implementation and rollout strategy
- Forward-thinking approaches to code maintainability and team scalability

### 2. System Algorithm Strategy

**Location:** `/python-algorithm`

**Objective:** Develop a strategic approach to implementing an algorithm at scale, considering system-wide implications, team capabilities, and long-term maintainability.

**Setup:**
```bash
cd python-algorithm
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

**Requirements:**
- Create a strategic implementation plan for the algorithm across multiple services
- Develop scaling considerations for handling growing data volumes and traffic patterns
- Design a testing strategy that encompasses unit, integration, and system-level validation
- Outline monitoring and observability requirements for production deployment
- Document architectural decisions, trade-offs, and risk mitigation strategies

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- System-level architectural thinking
- Strategic approach to algorithm scaling and optimization
- Cross-functional considerations (DevOps, SRE, Data Science)
- Risk identification and mitigation planning
- Alignment of technical solutions with business objectives

### 3. Enterprise Infrastructure Architecture

**Location:** `/infrastructure-fix`

**Objective:** Design and document a comprehensive infrastructure strategy for a CDK application with DynamoDB and Lambda, focusing on enterprise-grade reliability, security, and operational excellence.

**Setup:**
```bash
cd infrastructure-fix
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Requirements:**
- Develop a multi-environment infrastructure strategy (dev, staging, production)
- Create a security and compliance framework for cloud resources
- Design a disaster recovery and business continuity plan
- Establish cost optimization strategies without compromising performance
- Document infrastructure-as-code best practices for the engineering organization

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Strategic cloud architecture vision
- Security and compliance considerations at enterprise scale
- Operational excellence and reliability planning
- Cost optimization and resource efficiency strategies
- Technical governance and best practices implementation

### 4. Enterprise System Architecture

**Location:** `/system-design`

**Objective:** Create a comprehensive technical vision and roadmap for a mobile application ecosystem, including integration strategies, organizational alignment, and technology adoption plans.

**Requirements:**
- Develop a multi-year technical vision and roadmap based on business requirements
- Design integration architecture for existing enterprise systems
- Create team structure and ownership models for the proposed architecture
- Establish technology selection frameworks and governance processes
- Document risk management strategies and contingency plans

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Enterprise architectural vision and strategic thinking
- Alignment of technical strategy with business objectives
- Team structure and organizational design considerations
- Technology governance and decision-making frameworks
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning at enterprise scale

## Submission Guidelines

For each challenge:

1. Create a separate branch named `director-solution/[challenge-name]` (e.g., `director-solution/technical-strategy`)
2. Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive commit messages
3. Create a pull request against the main branch
4. In the PR description, include:
   - An executive summary of your strategic approach
   - Key architectural decisions and their rationales
   - Resource requirements and implementation timelines
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Success metrics and evaluation frameworks

## Time Expectations

While there is no strict time limit, these director-level challenges require deeper strategic thinking and comprehensive planning. We recommend spending:
- 2-4 hours on the Technical Strategy & Codebase Evaluation
- 2-4 hours on the System Algorithm Strategy
- 2-4 hours on the Enterprise Infrastructure Architecture
- 3-5 hours on the Enterprise System Architecture

You are not required to complete all challenges. Choose the ones that best showcase your strategic thinking and technical leadership capabilities or complete as many as you wish.

## Evaluation Process

Each challenge will be evaluated by our senior leadership team based on the criteria listed above. We value:
- Strategic technical vision and architectural thinking
- Ability to balance technical excellence with business objectives
- Comprehensive planning and resource allocation approaches
- Risk identification and mitigation strategies
- Cross-functional leadership and organizational considerations

We're more interested in your strategic approach and leadership thinking than in perfect technical solutions. Don't hesitate to document assumptions, alternative approaches you considered, and how you would guide teams through implementation challenges.

## Questions

If you have any questions about the challenges or the submission process, please reach out to the hiring team. We're happy to provide clarification.

Good luck!
