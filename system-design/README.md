# Enterprise System Architecture Challenge

## Overview

This challenge assesses your enterprise architectural vision and technical leadership capabilities - crucial competencies for Engineering Directors who need to make strategic technical decisions, guide multi-disciplinary teams, and align technology with business objectives. You will create a comprehensive technical vision and roadmap for a mobile application ecosystem, addressing organizational structure, governance, and cross-functional concerns.

## Challenge Description

Your company is planning to develop a new mobile application ecosystem called "HealthTrack" that helps users monitor and improve their health. As the Engineering Director, you've been tasked with creating a comprehensive enterprise architecture strategy, technology roadmap, and organizational design to deliver and sustain this platform as a core business offering.

### HealthTrack App Features

The application should support:

1. **User Management**

   - Sleep tracking
   - Nutrition logging and meal planning
   - Vital signs recording (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.)

3. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Sync with wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness trackers)
   - Import/export health data from/to other applications
   - Share achievements on social media platforms

4. **Personalization**
   - AI-powered health insights and recommendations
   - Custom fitness and nutrition plans
   - Goal setting and progress tracking

5. **Social Features**

   - In-app messaging for communication with health coaches

## Your Task

Develop a comprehensive enterprise architecture strategy that addresses the following aspects:

1. **Strategic Vision and Technology Roadmap**
   - 3-year technology vision and evolution strategy
   - Platform capabilities roadmap with phased implementation
   - Technology adoption framework for emerging technologies
   - Strategic partnerships and vendor management approach

2. **Enterprise Architecture Design**
   - System-wide architecture with integration patterns
   - Data governance and management strategy
   - Security and compliance framework
   - Technology standardization and platform consolidation

3. **Organizational Design and Governance**
   - Team structure and ownership model
   - Cross-functional collaboration framework
   - Technology governance processes
   - Knowledge management and community of practice approach

4. **Enterprise Implementation Strategy**

   - Resource allocation and capacity planning
   - Build vs. buy decision framework
   - Risk management and contingency planning

## Constraints and Considerations

- The organization is planning to make HealthTrack a flagship product with a 5-year investment horizon
- The platform must comply with global health data regulations with regular audit requirements
- The company currently has 5 development teams that operate semi-autonomously
- The ecosystem needs to support integrations with 50+ third-party health device manufacturers
- The business expects to scale to 5 million global users within 3 years
- The company has both cloud-native and legacy on-premise systems that need integration
- Budget constraints require a balance between immediate needs and long-term technical debt reduction
- The organization aims to expand through both organic growth and potential acquisitions

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1. **Enterprise Architectural Vision** - Does your strategy present a cohesive long-term technical vision aligned with business objectives?
2. **Strategic Planning** - Have you developed a realistic and actionable technology roadmap with clear milestones?
3. **Organizational Design** - How effectively does your team structure and governance model address cross-functional coordination?
4. **Risk Management** - Have you identified key enterprise risks and provided robust mitigation strategies?
5. **Resource Optimization** - Does your approach effectively balance resource allocation with business priorities?
6. **Technology Leadership** - How well do you articulate the guidance and direction you would provide to technology teams?
7. **Business Alignment** - How effectively does your technical strategy support business outcomes and growth?

## Submission Format

Please provide your solution as a comprehensive enterprise architecture strategy document (using the provided template) that includes:

1. **Executive summary** for C-level stakeholders
2. **Enterprise architecture vision** with capability roadmap
3. **Organizational design** and cross-team coordination framework
4. **Technology governance model** and decision-making framework
5. **Risk assessment and mitigation plan**
6. **Resource allocation strategy** and financial considerations
7. **Implementation roadmap** with phased delivery approach

Include diagrams to illustrate your strategic vision (you may use any diagramming tool like draw.io, Lucidchart, or even hand-drawn diagrams).

## Time Expectation
