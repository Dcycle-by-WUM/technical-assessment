# Mobile Application Architecture Design Challenge

## Overview

This challenge assesses your system design skills and architectural thinking - crucial competencies for engineering managers who need to make high-level technical decisions and guide teams in implementing complex systems. You will design the architecture for a mobile application based on specific requirements.

## Challenge Description

Your company is planning to develop a new mobile application called "HealthTrack" that helps users monitor and improve their health. As the Engineering Manager, you've been tasked with designing the system architecture for this application.

### HealthTrack App Features

The application should support:

1. **User Management**
   - Registration and authentication
   - Profile management
   - Preferences and settings

2. **Health Tracking**
   - Daily activity monitoring (steps, distance, calories)
   - Sleep tracking
   - Nutrition logging and meal planning
   - Vital signs recording (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.)

3. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Sync with wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness trackers)
   - Import/export health data from/to other applications
   - Share achievements on social media platforms

4. **Personalization**
   - AI-powered health insights and recommendations
   - Custom fitness and nutrition plans
   - Goal setting and progress tracking

5. **Social Features**
   - Connect with friends and family
   - Participate in challenges and competitions
   - Form and join community groups

6. **Additional Requirements**
   - Offline functionality with data synchronization
   - Push notifications for reminders and alerts
   - In-app messaging for communication with health coaches

## Your Task

Design a comprehensive mobile application architecture that addresses the following aspects:

1. **Overall Architecture**
   - Client-side architecture (mobile apps)
   - Backend services architecture
   - Data storage solutions
   - Third-party integrations

2. **Technical Components**
   - Frontend frameworks and libraries
   - Backend technologies and services
   - Database design and data management
   - API design and communication patterns

3. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Scalability approach for handling growth
   - Security measures for protecting sensitive health data
   - Performance considerations and optimizations
   - Reliability and fault tolerance strategies

4. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Development approach (native, cross-platform, hybrid)
   - DevOps and CI/CD pipeline
   - Testing strategy
   - Deployment and monitoring

## Constraints and Considerations

- The application must comply with health data regulations (HIPAA, GDPR)
- It should support both iOS and Android platforms
- The system should be designed to handle up to 1 million daily active users
- Real-time features should have minimal latency
- The architecture should enable quick feature iteration and deployment
- Budget constraints require a balance between custom development and managed services
- The development team consists of 5 mobile developers, 3 backend developers, and 2 DevOps engineers

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1. **Completeness** - Does your design address all the requirements?
2. **Technical soundness** - Is the architecture feasible and appropriate?
3. **Scalability** - Will the system handle growth effectively?
4. **Security** - Is user health data adequately protected?
5. **Maintainability** - How easy will it be to maintain and extend the system?
6. **Trade-off analysis** - How well do you explain your architectural decisions?
7. **Communication** - Clarity and effectiveness of your documentation and diagrams

## Submission Format

Please provide your solution as a comprehensive architecture document (using the provided template) that includes:

1. **Architecture overview diagram**
2. **Detailed component descriptions**
3. **Data flow diagrams**
4. **API design considerations**
5. **Security measures**
6. **Scalability approach**
7. **Trade-off analysis**

Include diagrams to illustrate your design (you may use any diagramming tool like draw.io, Lucidchart, or even hand-drawn diagrams).

## Time Expectation

We expect this challenge to take approximately 2-3 hours to complete.

## Additional Resources

- Review the `CONSTRAINTS.md` file for detailed technical constraints
- Use the `SOLUTION_TEMPLATE.md` file to structure your response
- Reference materials are provided in the `references` directory

# Mobile Application Architecture Design Challenge

## Overview

This challenge assesses your system design skills and architectural thinking - crucial competencies for engineering managers who need to make high-level technical decisions and guide teams in implementing complex systems. You will design the architecture for a mobile application based on specific requirements.

## Challenge Description

A company is planning to develop a new mobile application for tracking personal fitness and nutrition. As the Engineering Manager, you've been asked to design the system architecture for this application.

Your task is to:

1. Design a comprehensive architecture for the mobile application
2. Explain the technical components and their interactions
3. Address key considerations like scalability, security, and performance
4. Document your design decisions and their rationales

## Application Requirements

The mobile application should support the following features:

- User registration and authentication
- Daily tracking of exercise activities and nutritional intake
- Integration with wearable fitness devices
- Personalized recommendations based on user data
- Social features for connecting with friends and sharing achievements
- Offline functionality with data synchronization
- Analytics dashboard for tracking progress over time

## Evaluation Criteria

Your design will be evaluated based on:

1. **Completeness** - Does your architecture address all the requirements?
2. **Technical feasibility** - Is the design realistic and implementable?
3. **Scalability** - Will the architecture handle growth in users and data?
4. **Security** - Does the design adequately protect user data?
5. **Mobile considerations** - Does it address mobile-specific challenges?
6. **Trade-offs** - Do you explain the pros and cons of your design choices?
7. **Communication** - How clearly do you articulate your architectural decisions?

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create a comprehensive document (PDF or Markdown) with your architecture design
2. Include diagrams that illustrate the system components and their interactions
3. Explain the technologies chosen and why they're appropriate
4. Address specific considerations for both iOS and Android platforms
5. Discuss potential challenges and how your design mitigates them
