# Mobile Application Architecture Patterns

This document provides an overview of common architecture patterns for mobile applications, which may be helpful references for your design.

## Client-Side Architecture Patterns

### 1. Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Description**: Separates the application into three main components: the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (business logic).
- **Pros**: Simple to understand, widely adopted.
- **Cons**: Can lead to "massive view controller" problem in complex applications.

### 2. Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
- **Description**: Extends MVC by introducing a ViewModel that handles the presentation logic and state management.
- **Pros**: Better separation of concerns, testability, and data binding.
- **Cons**: Can be more complex for simple applications.

### 3. Clean Architecture
- **Description**: Divides an application into concentric layers, with dependencies pointing inward toward the domain layer.
- **Pros**: High separation of concerns, highly testable, framework-independent.
- **Cons**: More complex setup, requires discipline to maintain.

### 4. Redux/Flux Architecture
- **Description**: Unidirectional data flow with a central state store.
- **Pros**: Predictable state management, easy debugging, and good for complex UIs.
- **Cons**: Verbose, can be overkill for simple applications.

## Backend Architecture Patterns

### 1. Monolithic Architecture
- **Description**: A single application handles all backend functionality.
- **Pros**: Simpler development and deployment, easier to test end-to-end.
- **Cons**: Less scalable, potential for tight coupling.

### 2. Microservices Architecture
- **Description**: Backend functionality is divided into small, independent services.
- **Pros**: Independent scaling, technology diversity, resilience.
- **Cons**: More complex to develop, test, deploy, and monitor.

### 3. Serverless Architecture
- **Description**: Backend functionality is implemented as stateless functions triggered by events.
- **Pros**: Minimal operational overhead, pay-per-use, automatic scaling.
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, cold start issues, complex monitoring.

### 4. Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Pattern
- **Description**: Specialized backend services tailored to specific frontend needs.
- **Pros**: Better alignment with client requirements, performance optimization.
- **Cons**: Duplication of logic, more services to maintain.

## Data Architecture Patterns

### 1. Centralized Database
- **Description**: A single database serves all application needs.
- **Pros**: Simple to manage, consistent data.
- **Cons**: Single point of failure, scaling challenges.

### 2. Polyglot Persistence
- **Description**: Different data storage technologies for different types of data.
- **Pros**: Optimized for different data types and access patterns.
- **Cons**: Complexity in data consistency and integration.

### 3. Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- **Description**: Separates read and write operations into different models.
- **Pros**: Optimized for read and write performance separately.
- **Cons**: Increased complexity, eventual consistency challenges.

### 4. Event Sourcing
- **Description**: Stores state changes as a sequence of events rather than just the current state.
- **Pros**: Complete audit history, event replay capabilities.
- **Cons**: Complexity, learning curve, potential performance issues.

## Mobile-Specific Patterns

### 1. Offline-First Architecture
- **Description**: Designs the application to work primarily offline, with online capabilities as an enhancement.
- **Pros**: Works in poor connectivity, better user experience.
- **Cons**: Complexity in data synchronization and conflict resolution.

### 2. Responsive and Adaptive Design
- **Description**: UI adapts to different device sizes and orientations.
- **Pros**: Better user experience across devices.
- **Cons**: Increased development and testing effort.

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
- **Description**: Core functionality works on all devices, with enhanced functionality on capable devices.
- **Pros**: Broader device support, graceful degradation.
- **Cons**: Multiple implementation paths to maintain.

## Communication Patterns

### 1. RESTful API
- **Description**: Stateless, resource-based API communication.
- **Pros**: Simple, well-understood, cacheable.
- **Cons**: Multiple round-trips for complex operations, over-fetching.

### 2. GraphQL
- **Description**: Query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.
- **Pros**: Reduced network traffic, fewer round-trips, type safety.
- **Cons**: Complexity, potential for expensive queries, caching challenges.

### 3. WebSockets
- **Description**: Persistent connection for real-time, bidirectional communication.
- **Pros**: Real-time updates, reduced overhead for frequent communication.
- **Cons**: Complexity, connection management, less scalable.

### 4. gRPC
- **Description**: High-performance RPC framework using HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers.
- **Pros**: Efficient binary protocol, strong typing, code generation.
- **Cons**: Less human-readable, limited browser support.
