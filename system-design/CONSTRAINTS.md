# Technical Constraints and Requirements

This document outlines the detailed technical constraints and requirements for the HealthTrack mobile application architecture design challenge.

## Regulatory Requirements

### Data Privacy and Compliance
- **HIPAA Compliance**: The application must adhere to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards for storing and processing health data.
- **GDPR Compliance**: For users in the European Union, the system must comply with General Data Protection Regulation requirements.
- **Data Residency**: User data must be stored in region-specific data centers to comply with local regulations.

### Data Retention
- Health data must be retained for at least 7 years while allowing users the right to delete their data (subject to regulatory requirements).

## Performance Requirements

### Response Times
- API responses should be delivered within 200ms for most operations.
- Real-time features (e.g., activity tracking) should have latency under 500ms.
- Application startup time should be under 2 seconds on standard devices.

### Throughput
- The system should handle at least 5,000 requests per second during peak usage.
- Support for batch processing of health data uploads from devices.

### Offline Capability
- Mobile app must function with full feature set in offline mode.
- Data synchronization with conflict resolution when connectivity is restored.

## Scalability Requirements

### User Base
- Initial launch: 100,000 users
- Year 1 target: 500,000 users
- Year 2 target: 1,000,000+ users

### Data Volume
- Each user may generate up to 1MB of health data per day.
- System should handle storage of billions of data points.
- Analytics processing must scale to handle aggregation across the entire user base.

## Security Requirements

### Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication option for users.
- Secure password policies and recovery mechanisms.
- Optional biometric authentication on supporting devices.

### Data Security
- All health data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Proper key management and rotation policies.
- Access control with least privilege principle.
- Audit logging for all data access events.

### Vulnerability Management
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing.
- Dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline.

## Technical Environment

### Mobile Platforms
- iOS: Support for iOS 14 and newer (>95% of iOS user base)
- Android: Support for Android 8.0 and newer (>90% of Android user base)

### Backend Environment
- Cloud-native architecture preferred.
- Option for multi-region deployment.
- Disaster recovery with RPO < 15 minutes and RTO < 1 hour.

## Development Constraints

### Team Composition
- 5 mobile developers (3 iOS, 2 Android)
- 3 backend developers
- 2 DevOps engineers
- 1 data engineer
- 2 QA engineers

### Timeframe
- MVP: 3 months
- Full feature set: 12 months

### Budget Constraints
- Development budget: $750,000 for the first year
- Infrastructure budget: $15,000 per month, with flexibility to scale

## Integration Requirements

### Wearable Devices
- Integration with major fitness trackers and smartwatches:
  - Apple Health and Apple Watch
  - Google Fit
  - Fitbit
  - Garmin
  - Samsung Health

### Third-party Services
- Nutrition database for food logging
- Weather services for outdoor activity recommendations
- Social media sharing capabilities
- Telehealth service integration

## Accessibility Requirements

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all user interfaces.
- Support for screen readers and voice control.
- Customizable text sizes and high contrast mode.

## Analytics Requirements

- User behavior analytics to improve app experience.
- Health data analytics for personalized recommendations.
- Performance monitoring for application optimization.
- Conversion and retention metrics.

## Additional Considerations

- Internationalization support for 10+ languages.
- Cultural adaptations for health recommendations.
- Support for different measurement systems (imperial/metric).
